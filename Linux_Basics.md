# üåê Beginner-Friendly Networking Tools for Linux

This section introduces you to common command-line tools to check and explore networks. No experience needed‚Äîjust curiosity!

---

## üîç 1. `ping` ‚Äî Test if a computer is reachable

- **What it does:** Sends a small message to another computer to see if it's online and how fast the response is.
- **Why it's useful:** You can check if your internet is working, or if a specific website or device is reachable.

### Example:
```bash
ping google.com
```

### What it might show:
```text
PING google.com (142.250.200.142) 56(84) bytes of data.
64 bytes from 142.250.200.142: icmp_seq=1 ttl=117 time=20.4 ms
64 bytes from 142.250.200.142: icmp_seq=2 ttl=117 time=21.1 ms
```

## üìÑ 2. `ip a` ‚Äî Show your computer‚Äôs IP address

- **What it does:** Displays all network interfaces and their IP addresses.
- **Why it's useful:** You‚Äôll need this to find your local IP address, especially for LAN scanning.

### Example:
```bash
ip a
```

### What it might show:
```text
2: eth0: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP> ...
    inet 192.168.1.42/24 brd 192.168.1.255 scope global dynamic eth0
```

---

## üìä 3. `netstat` or `ss` ‚Äî See open ports and connections

- **What it does:** Lists the network connections your computer is making and ports it's listening on.
- **Why it's useful:** Useful for spotting unexpected programs connecting to the internet or checking if your server is running.

### Example:
```bash
netstat -tulnp
```

### What it might show:
```text
Proto Recv-Q Send-Q Local Address           Foreign Address         State       PID/Program name
tcp        0      0 0.0.0.0:22              0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN      743/sshd
udp        0      0 0.0.0.0:68              0.0.0.0:*                           644/dhclient
```

---

## üîé 4. `nmap` ‚Äî Scan other computers on the network

- **What it does:** Checks what ports are open on a remote computer and tries to guess what services are running.
- **Why it's useful:** Helps you understand what other machines are doing and if they might be vulnerable.

### Example:
```bash
nmap -sV 192.168.1.10
```

### What it might show:
```text
PORT     STATE SERVICE  VERSION
22/tcp   open  ssh      OpenSSH 8.2
80/tcp   open  http     Apache httpd 2.4.41
```

## üëÄ 5. `arp-scan` ‚Äî Discover devices on your local network

- **What it does:** Finds every device connected to the same Wi-Fi or LAN.
- **Why it's useful:** Great way to see who‚Äôs sharing your network‚Äîeven hidden or unnamed devices.

### Example:
```bash
sudo arp-scan --interface=eth0 --localnet
```

### What it might show:
```text
192.168.1.1  00:11:22:33:44:55  TP-Link Technologies
192.168.1.42 00:0c:29:ab:cd:ef  Raspberry Pi Foundation
```

## üß† Bonus Tools

### üí¨ `traceroute` ‚Äî Follow the path to a website

- **What it does:** Shows every server your data passes through on its way to a website.
- **Why it‚Äôs cool:** Helps spot where network delays or issues might be happening.

```bash
traceroute example.com
```

---

### üåê `dig` or `nslookup` ‚Äî Check domain name info (DNS)

- **What it does:** Asks the internet‚Äôs ‚Äúphone book‚Äù what IP address a domain (like `bing.com`) uses.
- **Why it matters:** Understanding DNS is key to how the web works.

```bash
dig microsoft.com
```

---

### üì• `tcpdump` ‚Äî Capture all network traffic (advanced)

- **What it does:** Records packets (tiny data chunks) going in and out of your computer.
- **Why it matters:** Very powerful for analyzing or debugging network behavior.

```bash
sudo tcpdump -i eth0
```
